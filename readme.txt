Grouped each pattern in it's own package so it's easy to identify.
My project is a little bit complex so i would like to explain how to run it.
The four design patterns selected for the billing system project are: command, factory, singleton, and state. All these patterns have different classes that support each design pattern .The Unit tests are runned specifically on two design patterns :Factory pattern and State Pattern.
I called classes from each pattern from their given packages in the final class BillTestDrive.java thats is in the State Design pattern.
Instructions:
Run Driver.java class from the billingSystemsCommand package.
Run BillTestDrive.java class from the billingsysytemsFactory package.
Run Driver.javvs class from billingSystemsSingleton package.
Run the BillTestDrive class in the billingSystemsState package.
There you can see the output.

Unit test are run on billinSystemsFactory (FactoryTest.java) and billingSystemsState (StateUnitTest.java)
